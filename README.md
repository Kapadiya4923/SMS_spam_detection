# SMS_spam_detection
During my internship, I developed an SMS spam detection project using machine learning. The goal was to classify messages as spam or ham. I preprocessed text data, trained models, and achieved accuracy in predictions. This project enhanced my skills in text classification, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation metrics.
